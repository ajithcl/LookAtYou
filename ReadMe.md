## Who can use this?
Everyone who want's to track their daily stuffs, expenses, learnings, books read etc.
## What's the use?
Through this webpage we can track our Expenses, Learnings, Reminders etc,
Started this project as a learning project, continuing to add new stufs based on the needs.
It's web based project, built in Python, Java script, Bootstrap framework, HTML5 and MongoDB used for backend.
This project is not yet completed and I added things based on my personal needs.

## How to run the process for the daily use?
For the daily use, batch script can be created which will run the startup program, 'Controller.py'. If required we can schedule this batch script in the task scheduler, so that web service can run whenever we are logging to the system.
